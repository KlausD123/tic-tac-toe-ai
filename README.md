# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe (3×3 & 4×4) – Web Game with AI

This is a simple and interactive **Tic Tac Toe web game** built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The game supports **two board sizes (3×3 and 4×4)** and allows players to either play with a friend or challenge an AI.

The AI player is implemented using the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning**, which helps it make smart moves while keeping the response time under **2 seconds**.
